# Getting started

Ryba is a Node.js tool to deploy and configure hadoop nodes through SSH.
This project contain a pre-configured environnement to get you started quickly
with a cluster of virtual machines. From there, you can update the configuration and adapt it
to your need based on your production environnement.

# Install Process

## VMs

We use Vagrant to boostrap a cluster of virtual machines (VMs). Feel free to tweek
the default Vagrant definition located in "./resources/Vagrantfile" with your own
topology. The current definition set up a cluster of 6 VMs and require 16GB of memory.
